Useful tools and utilities for working with PC-FX programming

## python/grb2yuv

Converter for PC Engine-type palette entries (GRB) to PC-FX YUV-type
palette entries.  Does not currently take into account the RGB-to-YCrCb
conversion inside of the HuC6260, but yields a decent approximation of
colours.

## python/cvtdefpal

Converter for PCEAS 'defpal'-style palette entry sequences (RGB) to
corresponding 16-bit YUV values for inclusion into PC-FX programs
